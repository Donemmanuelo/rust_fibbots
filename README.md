# FIBBOTS
. Fibbots simply means automated fibo (short for fibonacci). So fibbot is a project that read file content( all pull request content), parse it and extract numeracal value inother to find their fibonacci and print it output as comment to pull request. The program only runs on pull request event, meaning it this process is triggered only when you do a pull request.
. The program has two parameter known as max_threshold and enable_fib. So the max_threshold is the maximum amount of numerical value the fibonacci function is can calculate and the enable_fib is used to accept or denied the computation of numerical value.
## USES
- used to find the fibonnacci of any numerical value found in a pull request.
